<h1>Bernie Sanders on the issues</h1>
<h2>Medicare for All</h2>
<p>We say to the private health insurance companies: whether you like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. All Americans are entitled to go to the doctor when they're sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital.
</p>
<h2>Green New Deal</h2>
<p>The climate crisis is not only the single greatest challenge facing our country; it is also our single greatest opportunity to build a more just and equitable future, but we must act immediately.
</p>
<h2>College For All</h2>
<p>Today, we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can, regardless of the income of your family. Good jobs require a good education. That is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt.
</p>
<h2>Workplace Democracy</h2>
<p>It was the trade union movement that built the middle class in this country, and it is the trade union movement that is going to rebuild the middle class in America once again.
</p>
<h2>Expand Social Security</h2>
<p>Today, we say to our senior citizens, that we understand that you cannot live in dignity when you are trying to survive on $13,000 or $14,000 a year in Social Security benefits. My Republican colleagues want to cut Social Security but we have some bad news for them. We’re not going to cut Social Security benefits. We’re going to expand them.
</p>
<h2>Housing for All</h2>
<p>In the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right.
</p>
<h2>Justice and Safety for All</h2>
<p>Today, we say to the prison-industrial-complex that we are going to bring about real criminal justice reform. We are going to end the international embarrassment of having more people in jail than any other country on earth. Instead of spending $80 billion a year on jails and incarceration, we are going to invest in jobs and education for our young people. No more private prisons and detention centers. No more profiteering from locking people up. No more "war on drugs." No more keeping people in jail because they're too poor to afford cash bail.
</p>
<h2>Eliminating Medical Debt</h2>
<p>No one in America should go bankrupt because of medical debt. We will eliminate all past due medical debt in this country.
</p>
<h2>Reinvest in Public Education</h2>
<p>“Every human being has the fundamental right to a good education. On this 65th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, we are committed to creating an education system that works for all people, not just the wealthy and powerful.”
</p>
<h2>Tax on Extreme Wealth</h2>
<p>In order to reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today and to rebuild the disappearing middle class, we must establish an annual tax on the extreme wealth of the top 0.1%.
</p>
<h2>Fair Banking for All</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Racial Justice</h2>
<p>When we are in the White House, we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist overall in our nation, but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income. We are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists.
</p>
<h2>Free and Fair Elections</h2>
<p>Together, we are going to create a political system which is based on the democratic principles of one person - one vote - and end a corrupt system which allows billionaires to buy elections. Yes. We are going to overturn Citizens United, move to public funding of elections.
</p>
<h2>Revitalizing Rural America</h2>
<p>Fundamental change in America’s agricultural and rural policies is no longer just an option; it’s an absolute necessity. With the right support and policies, we can have rural communities that are thriving economically and ecologically.
</p>
<h2>Income Inequality Tax Plan</h2>
<p>The American people want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.
</p>
<h2>Caring for Our Veterans</h2>
<p>If you can't afford to take care of your veterans, then don't go to war. These people are bearing the brunt of what war is about. We have a moral obligation to support them.
</p>
<h2>Responsible Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>Together, as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars, we have stood arm-in-arm to fight back. We're not going to invest in never-ending wars.
</p>
<h2>Women’s Rights</h2>
<p>When we are in the White House, we are going to protect a woman’s right to control her own body. That is her decision, not the government's.
</p>
<h2>Disability Rights</h2>
<p>We as a nation have a moral responsibility to ensure that all Americans have access to the programs and the support needed to contribute to society, live with dignity, and achieve a high quality of life.
</p>
<h2>Get Corporate Money Out of Politics</h2>
<p>Our grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don't need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president.
</p>
<h2>LGBTQ+ Equality</h2>
<p>People have the right to love who they want to love and get married regardless of their sexual orientation. Incredibly, today in many states, it is still legal to fire someone for being gay. That is unacceptable and must change.
</p>
<h2>Empower Puerto Rico</h2>
<p>Now is the time to rebuild Puerto Rico. I want the people of Puerto Rico to know that they are not forgotten, that they are not alone, and that we will do everything we possibly can to rebuild the island.
</p>
<h2>Tax Increases for the Rich</h2>
<p>The wealthy and multinational corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes. We are going to end austerity for working families, and provide some austerity for large, multinational corporations.
</p>
<h2>Gun Safety</h2>
<p>When we are in the White House, we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of Americans want.
</p>
<h2>Legalizing Marijuana</h2>
<p>We will legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions.
</p>
<h2>Immigration Reform</h2>
<p>Today, we say to the American people that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country, we’re going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship. We’re going to provide legal status to the 1.8 million young people eligible for the DACA program, and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum. No more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers.
</p>
<h2>Empowering Tribal Nations</h2>
<p>Time and time again, our Native American brothers and sisters have seen the federal government break solemn promises, and huge corporations put profits ahead of the sovereign rights of Native communities. I will stand with Native Americans in the struggle to protect their treaty and sovereign rights, advance traditional ways of life, and improve the quality of life for Native communities.
</p>
<h2>Real Wall Street Reform</h2>
<p>I want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of Wall Street, corporate America and the billionaire class – greed which has resulted in this country having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth.
</p>
<h2>Fair Trade</h2>
<p>We need a trade policy that benefits American workers and creates living-wage jobs, not unfair trade agreements written by multi-national corporations.
</p>
<h2>Jobs for All</h2>
<p>When we are in the White House, we will enact a federal jobs guarantee, to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job. There is more than enough work to be done in this country. Let's do it.
</p>
<h2>Corporate Accountability and Democracy</h2>
<p>We will give workers an ownership stake in the companies they work for, break up corrupt corporate mergers and monopolies, and finally make corporations pay their fair share.
